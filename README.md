👋 Hi, I’m Deepanshu Sonkhla

🚀 Software Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | AI-Curious Builder

I’m a hands-on developer with 6+ years of experience building scalable web applications using LAMP and MERN stacks. I enjoy turning messy requirements into clean, maintainable systems—and lately, I’m deep into modernizing legacy apps, cloud-first architectures, and AI-powered features.

I don’t just ship code. I think about performance, scale, UX, and the business impact behind every line.

🧠 What I’m Focused On Right Now

🔄 Transforming monolithic apps → modular & scalable systems

🤖 Exploring AI-first SaaS ideas (recommendations, automation, analytics)

🧩 Building products that actually solve real problems

💡 How I Think About Development

“Good code is not just working code — it’s code that survives change.”

I believe:

Simplicity beats cleverness

Scalability matters from day one

AI will assist developers, not replace builders who understand systems

🌱 Currently Learning / Exploring

AI integrations in production apps

DevRel & Developer Advocacy mindset

Forward-deployed engineering models

Better system design for long-term products
